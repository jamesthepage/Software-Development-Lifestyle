# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Interpreting user needs begins from conducting surveys, having daily discussion within the team, and breaking down needs into smaller parts.

User stories help with this by listing the users end goal, what is expected from the customer and why this helps, improve communication towards each role as well
as the users, and prioritizing each request from large to small.
# How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
To approach developing prograsms, I begin by breaking things down into smaller pieces and making sure I prioritize each sprint 
so I don't overwhelm myself doing everything at once, or wasting time working on low priority tasks at the beginning. I hope to incorporate
mapping out a quick plan based on what is expected in the outcome, as well as a strong sense of communication within my team and the user.
# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member in software development includes knowing your role, having open communication within your team, 
keeping up with your work so you don't hold the team back, always listen to other team members to combine ideas as well
as showing respect, and always getting involved.
